# Excel_Workstation
A home-made Workingstation mainly for Excel to deal with some troublesome problems

## Why I decide to do this
In my past working time as a student cadre, there are lots of troublesome work for me to deal with, such as collecting workbooks containing everyone's information, looking up lots of information from other files, and the toughest of which is that sending each class's information seperately to the corresponding principal of each class in consideration of students' privacy(A lof of information of privacy such as the economy status of a family are involved in my job).

For more efficient work, I wrote some program with Python to promote my work.

## Introduction to members of the station
**Excel_Seperator**: According to the item you choose , it can seperate the Excel workbook into pieces in the form of workbooks or worksheets in a workbook named after the values of the item. The results will be put into the folder Attachments.

**Excel_Merge**: First you place the workbooks you are merging into the folder Attachments, and then you boot the program, the results will be put in the folder where the program is.

**Excel_preview**: Before you merging workbooks, you can preview the each workbook's certain worksheet together.

**Auto_Email**: According to the Excel workbook "邮件发送列表" in the folder Configuration, the program will send the Attachments in the folder Attachments to the corresponding person via email SMTP.

**File_Management**: A small explorer, mainly used to find the files with multiple keywords(the first one must be in the filename), which can be in the absolute path for more accurate search, and then, you can copy them to the current folder with a click. due to my major is not computing science(my major is applied mathematics), which is just my hobby, I can only use algorithm recursion to implement it, just for special use only.

## I want to say
I wrote these originally for promoting my working efficiency, and during the coding time, a number of thoughts occurred in my mind.
Welcome everyone interested in my code to cooperate with me to improve my code, and give me precious recommandations, thank you.
